# üëã Hi, I'm Jasmine! 

üéì**Junior** at Penn State Univeristy, studying **Electrical Engineering and Mathematics**  


I love tackling real-world problems through predictive modeling and computer vision. I‚Äôm big on continuously learning and building my skills, and believe taking initiative is key to growth. *(Ask me about growing my technical skills and leadership as a [Break Through Tech Fellow](#)!)*  

Currently, I‚Äôm focusing on building machine learning models and computer vision projects. I‚Äôm looking to leverage and grow my skills in an internship or research environment where I can contribute to exciting projects.

## üöÄ Projects

### 1. Coupling from the Past for Statistical Mechanics Models REU Project
- **Overview**: Conducted research under the mentorship of Dr. Pierre Bellec on modeling statistical mechanics models using Coupling from the Past (perfect sampling) to simulate phase transitions. Project funded by NSF grant CNS-2150186.
- **Results**: [Final Paper](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/~jk2264/JasmineKhalilFinalPaper.pdf)
- **Advisor**: [Dr. Pierre Bellec](https://statweb.rutgers.edu/PCB71/)

### 2. 3D Augmentation with COLMAP
- **Overview**: Developed an augmented reality (AR) viewer by integrating computer vision, geometry, and graphics, featuring 3D scene reconstruction, plane detection with RANSAC, and 3D-to-2D projection for virtual object placement.
- **Results**: [Final Paper]()
- **Advisor**: [Dr. Robert Collins]

### 3. Camera Projection, Triangulation, & Epipolar Geometry
- **Overview**: Developed and implemented techniques for 3D reconstruction from 2D images in a motion capture setup. Utilized camera calibration
parameters, triangulation, and the eight-point algorithm to recover spatial information about the scene and relationships between two
views.
- **Results**: [Final Paper](https://jasminekhalil.github.io/assets/pdf/camera_projection_project.pdf)
- **Advisor**: [Dr. Robert Collins]
